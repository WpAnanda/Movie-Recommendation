# Movie-Recommendation
A side project on creating a simple movie recommendation system based on MovieLens dataset, various methods such as machine learning models (SVM, KNN, etc), collaborative filtering, etc are used.
This readme will serve to explain on the codes and walk you through on whats happening through the code.

## Preface
In this project, there will be 2 types to create a movie recommendation system. Which are:
* Pre-made recommendation system, which means that it is using pre-made machine learning models, and pretty much are using collaborative-filtering method to do the job. (Will be explained later)
* Content-based recommendation system, which means that it recommends the movie based on the users profile (preferences and tastes)

## Dataset
The dataset used is MovieLens, although the one that being in use is an older dataset, it contains 100,000 movie ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies.
It is released on 4/1998. And it can be downloaded [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip).

There are a four separate CSV files,
